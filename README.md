## 📌 Short abstract
This project implements an autonomous, sensor-fusion based mobile ATC drone that augments air traffic management in urban and remote areas. It integrates LiDAR, radar, ADS-B, GPS/IMU, and AI-driven routing for collision avoidance and dynamic traffic coordination.

---

## 🔑 Key results (from paper)
- **Collision avoidance success rate:** **98.7%**.  
- **Average flight path deviation (signal-weak areas):** **1.5 m**.  
- **Average response time to traffic changes:** **1.2 s**.
